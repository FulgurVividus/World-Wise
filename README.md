# World Wise 🌎🧭

## Overview 💥

World Wise is a Single-Page Application (SPA) built with React and Vite. This project serves as a practice platform for various advanced React concepts, including React Router, Context API, memoization techniques (memo, useMemo, useCallback), and CSS Modules. The application utilizes external libraries like Leaflet, react-leaflet, and react-datepicker, and it features a fake API for data storage, implemented within the package.json file.

## Technologies Used 🧑‍💻

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web projects, offering a superior development experience.
- **React Router**: For routing within the application.
- **Context API**: For state management across the application.
- **CSS Modules**: For scoped and modular CSS styling.

## External Libraries 📚

- **Leaflet**: A JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- **react-leaflet**: React components for Leaflet maps.
- **react-datepicker**: A simple and reusable datepicker component for React.

## API 🛜
